# ESLint and Prettier Setup Guide

This guide explains how to properly configure and integrate ESLint and Prettier into your project to maintain clean, consistent code. The instructions cover how to use these tools both via the terminal and through extensions.

## ESLint Configuration

### Setting Up ESLint via Terminal

Follow these steps to set up and configure ESLint in your project using the terminal:

1. **Initialize Your npm Project**  
   Create or ensure your project has a `package.json` file by running:

   ```bash
   npm init -y
   ```

2. **Install ESLint**  
   Visit the [ESLint official website](https://eslint.org/) and install ESLint in your project by running:

   ```bash
   npm init @eslint/config@latest
   ```

3. **Follow the Setup Prompts**  
   During the installation process, follow the prompts to choose the rules and configurations you want for your project.

4. **Check ESLint Rules**  
   Refer to the [ESLint documentation](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/rules) to review available rules and configure them as needed.

5. **Custom Rule Configuration**  
   After installing ESLint, you will find a file named `eslint.config.mjs` in your project. You can customize your ESLint rules by adding configurations directly to this file. For example:

   ```javascript
   {
     "rules": {
       "no-unused-vars": "warn"
     }
   }
   ```

   This configuration will issue a warning instead of an error when there are unused variables in your code.

6. **Add Scripts to `package.json`**  
   Add these scripts to your `package.json` file for easy access to linting commands:

   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "lint": "eslint .",
     "lint:fix": "eslint --fix"
   }
   ```

   Now, you can run the following commands to check and fix linting errors:

   ```bash
   npm run lint       # Check for linting errors
   npm run lint:fix   # Automatically fix linting errors
   ```

### Setting Up ESLint via Extension

You can also set up ESLint using a Visual Studio Code extension, making it easier to lint your code automatically while you write.

1. **Install the ESLint Extension**  
   Open Visual Studio Code and install the ESLint extension from the Extensions Marketplace.

2. **Configure the Extension**  
   After installing the extension, ESLint will start working in the background as you code, showing linting errors directly in the editor.

3. **Sync with Workspace Settings**  
   To make ESLint work across different projects or editors, you can add the following settings to your `settings.json` file in the `.vscode` folder:

   ```json
   {
   	"editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
   		"source.fixAll.eslint": true
   	}
   }
   ```

   This will ensure that ESLint automatically fixes issues on save.

## Prettier Configuration

### Setting Up Prettier via Terminal

Prettier is a code formatter that enforces a consistent style. Follow these steps to configure Prettier using the terminal:

1. **Initialize Your npm Project**  
   Make sure your project has a `package.json` file:

   ```bash
   npm init -y
   ```

2. **Install Prettier**  
   Visit the [Prettier official website](https://prettier.io/) and install it by running:

   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev --save-exact prettier
   ```

3. **Create Prettier Configuration File**  
   Add a `.prettierrc` file to your project to define formatting rules. You can find the available options on the [Prettier configuration page](https://prettier.io/docs/en/options).

4. **Create a Prettier Ignore File**  
   Add a `.prettierignore` file to specify which files Prettier should ignore.

5. **Run Prettier**  
   To check which files will be formatted, run:
   ```bash
   npx prettier .
   ```
   To apply the formatting to all files, use:
   ```bash
   npx prettier --write .
   ```

### Setting Up Prettier via Extension

1. **Install the Prettier Extension**  
   Open Visual Studio Code and install the Prettier extension from the Extensions Marketplace.

2. **Configure Prettier Settings**  
   Once installed, you can configure Prettier settings by creating a `settings.json` file inside the `.vscode` folder, or adjusting the settings via the editor's preferences.

3. **Use Prettier on Save**  
   To automatically format files on save, add the following configuration to `settings.json`:
   ```json
   {
   	"editor.formatOnSave": true
   }
   ```

## Integrating ESLint and Prettier

### Using `eslint-plugin-prettier`

To integrate Prettier with ESLint and avoid conflicting rules, you can use `eslint-plugin-prettier`. Follow these steps:

1. **Install the Plugin and Config File**  
   Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install -D eslint-plugin-prettier eslint-config-prettier
   ```

2. **Configure ESLint to Use Prettier**  
   In your `eslint.config.mjs` file, add the Prettier plugin:

   ```javascript
   import eslintPluginPrettier from "eslint-plugin-prettier/recommended";
   ```

3. **Add the Plugin to ESLint Configuration**  
   Enable `eslint-plugin-prettier` in your ESLint configuration by adding it to your `.eslintrc` file:

   ```json
   {
   	"extends": ["plugin:prettier/recommended"]
   }
   ```

4. **Apply Rules Automatically in VSCode**  
   You can also create a `settings.json` file in the `.vscode` folder to apply these rules across different workspaces:
   ```json
   {
   	"editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
   		"source.fixAll.eslint": true
   	}
   }
   ```

This ensures that ESLint and Prettier work together harmoniously, fixing and formatting your code whenever you save.
